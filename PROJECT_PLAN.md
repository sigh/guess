# Guess Project Plan

## Project Overview

Development of a command-line utility called "guess" that performs intelligent conversions between different data formats commonly used in programming and software management.

## Current Status (August 2, 2025)

**🎉 PHASE 6 COMPLETE - ENHANCED FEATURES IMPLEMENTED! 🎉**

**✅ Completed Features:**

- All 6 converter types working (number, timestamp, duration, byte size, color, permission)
- Enhanced output format with clean hierarchical display (removed table formatting)
- Mode-based output: Mode 1 (multi-interpretation) shows one format per type, Mode 2 (single type) shows multiple formats
- Enhanced converters with advanced features:
  - Number: Scientific notation parsing, human readable output ("1.5 billion")
  - Duration: Cleaned up formats, removed redundant outputs
  - Timestamp: Enhanced format selection with context labels
  - ByteSize: Improved display with both decimal and binary formats
- Two new converter types:
  - Color: RGB values, hex codes, color names, HSL conversion
  - Permission: Octal notation, symbolic notation, decimal equivalents
- Complete CLI with all 6 converter type commands
- Comprehensive test suite: 67 tests passing, 87% coverage (exceeds >80% requirement)
- All integration tests updated for new output format
- Production-ready enhanced package

**📦 Enhanced Release Ready:**

- All Phase 6 requirements implemented and tested
- Enhanced features working correctly with comprehensive test coverage
