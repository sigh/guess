- **Edge cases**: Handling negative numbers, very large numbers, malformed input

### Low Risk

- **Basic conversions**: Core conversion logic is straightforward
- **CLI interface**: Well-established patterns available
- **Performance**: Simple operations should be fast enough
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Using only built-in Python modules

## Development Notes & Lessons Learned

### Common Issues Encountered

1. **Python Environment Management**
   - **Issue**: `externally-managed-environment` error when trying to install packages
   - **Solution**: Always read error messages carefully - they provide the exact solution
   - **Best Practice**: Use virtual environments (`python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`)
   - **Action**: Always activate the virtual environment before running tests or installing packages

2. **Test Failures and Debugging**
   - **Issue**: Getting stuck on pytest installation instead of reading actual test failure messages
   - **Solution**: Focus on the actual error messages from test failures, not environment issues
   - **Best Practice**: When tests fail, read the assertion errors carefully to understand what's broken
   - **Action**: Fix the test environment first, then focus on test content

3. **Table Formatting Truncation**
   - **Issue**: Multi-interpretation view cutting off important data (octal format missing)
   - **Root Cause**: `_get_display_values()` limiting to 3 lines per converter
   - **Solution**: Increase limit and prioritize core formats for specific converter types
   - **Best Practice**: Test with actual expected output, don't assume formatter behavior

4. **Exit Code Handling**
   - **Issue**: CLI returning exit code 0 for invalid input instead of 1
   - **Root Cause**: Checking `if output:` instead of `if results:` in main.py
   - **Solution**: Check the actual data (results list) not the formatted output string
   - **Best Practice**: Separate data validation from presentation logic

5. **Development Workflow Issues**
   - **Issue**: Getting distracted by environment setup instead of focusing on actual bugs
   - **Solution**: Set up environment once properly, then focus on code issues
   - **Best Practice**: Read error messages completely before assuming the problem

### Testing Strategy Improvements

1. **Always test incrementally** - Don't write large test suites without running them
2. **Use virtual environments consistently** - Avoids environment conflicts
3. **Read error messages completely** - They often contain the exact solution
4. **Test both positive and negative cases** - Don't just test happy path
5. **Verify exit codes in CLI testing** - Important for proper CLI behavior

### Code Quality Reminders

1. **Separate concerns**: Data logic vs presentation logic
2. **Test edge cases**: Empty input, invalid input, boundary conditions
3. **Check return values**: Don't assume functions return what you expect
4. **Prioritize important information**: In display logic, show most useful data first
